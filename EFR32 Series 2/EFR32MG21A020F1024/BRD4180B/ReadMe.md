# Silabs BRD4180B Applications and Bootloaders

These are simple example apps I have compiled for testing the silabs BRD4180B.

The apps are standard as released by Silabs but I don't enable flow control.

The bootloader is set to internal storage 1Mb device.

Suffix is the GSDK Version Number, eg -730 is GSDK4, EmberZNet 7.3.0
